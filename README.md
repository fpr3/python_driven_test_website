# python_driven_test_website

This is a quickly thrown together site solely for exploring python web development using Flask. These efforts were brought on in conjunction with developing potential IoT hardware on top of the Raspberry Pi (RasPi) platform.

The RasPi was already running Raspbian (Jessie) before consideration was given to a web-based interface. The OS was fully updated and the latest revision of Python3 was installed along with python3-pip. Sbsequently Flask was installed with <nowiki>sudo pip3 install flask</nowiki>.

The basic app was implemented as described in [Create a Basic Python Web Server with Flask](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2017/07/create-a-basic-python-web-server-with-flask/). This yields a rudimentary set of pages where a couple of routes demonstrate the use of templates and another couple show how information can be embedded in the URL string itself.

Next, ... boostrap, font-awesome, and jquery.countdown
